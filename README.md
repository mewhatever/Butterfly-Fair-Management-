The Butterfly Fair Management System is a comprehensive software designed to efficiently manage all aspects of organizing and overseeing a butterfly fair event. With a user-friendly interface and robust functionality, the system offers two distinct modes: User mode and Admin mode.

In the User mode, participants and attendees can register and log in to access a range of features tailored to enhance their fair experience. These features include browsing event schedules, registering for workshops and activities, purchasing tickets, managing their bookings, reviewing past attendance, and updating their profiles with relevant information.

Switching to Admin mode, authorized administrators gain access to a suite of tools to streamline fair management tasks. From overseeing event logistics to ensuring smooth operations, administrators can view detailed event information, add new workshops or activities, delete outdated entries, manage attendee registrations, and maintain the integrity of the system by modifying administrative settings, including the admin password.

Built on the principles of C++ Object-Oriented Programming, the Butterfly Fair Management System promises reliability, scalability, and flexibility to cater to the unique needs of organizing and executing successful butterfly fairs.
Objectives: 
The main objective of the Butterfly Fair Management System is to provide an efficient and easy to-use interface for users. The system also aims to provide the admin with the necessary tools to manage the system effectively. 
 
Design and Implementation: 
The Butterfly Fair Management System is designed using C++ Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The system has two classes and some sub-classes, the User class, volunteer class, Butterfly class and the Admin class. The User class is responsible for managing the user-related operations, such as registration, login, viewing volunteer profile, addition or deletion volunteer, cancelling tickets, viewing Butterfly characteristics, and viewing Butterfly species. The Admin class is responsible for managing the admin-related operations, such as set the admin password, changing the admin password. 
 
File Handling: 
For the Butterfly Management System, a file-based database is utilized to store attendee and Butterfly information efficiently. Separate files are maintained for users and butterlfy, and data is loaded into memory upon system initialization.
This file-based approach ensures streamlined data management and retrieval, enabling the system to efficiently handle attendee and Butterfly information, enhancing overall performance and user experience.
 
Privacy maintenances: 
The system has a login module that checks the user's credentials and allows access to the user or admin mode accordingly. The system also has input validation checks to ensure that the data entered by the user is valid.
